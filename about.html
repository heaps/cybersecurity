                <p>Professor Williams is Director of MIT's Geospatial Data Center and MIT's Auto-ID Laboratory that is architecting “The Internet of Things”. He was named as one of the 50 most powerful people in Computer Networks. He served on the Architectural Review Committee for EPCglobal Inc. and was Co-Director of the global alliance of Auto-ID Laboratories. Recent projects include Grid/Agent Computing, simulating the U.S. critical infrastructure at the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC), and architecting the cyber physical Internet, addressing the 4Ws (What, Where, When, and Why). He was also Co-Director of MIT's System Design and Management Program, MIT's first distance-learning program. He has been involved in developing E-Educational software for Microsoft via their I-Campus Program and with establishing the Accenture Technology Academy, an online resource for over 200,000 employees. His research focuses on large scale simulation and he has published 2 books and over 150 research papers. He teaches two MIT courses, on data science and cybersecurity and has produced over 100 educational videos.</p>

                <p>Dr. Abel Sanchez holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is the Executive Director of MIT's Geospatial Data Center, architect of "The Internet of Things" global network, and architect of data analytics platforms for SAP, Ford, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Altria. In cyber security, Dr. Sanchez architected impact analysis of large-scale cyber attacks designing Cyber Ranges for the Department of Defense (DOD). In password security, Dr. Sanchez led the design of a password firewall (negative authentication) for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) agency. In machine learning, addressing fraud detection, Dr. Sanchez designed a situational awareness framework that exploits different perspectives of the same data and assigns risk scores to entities for Accenture. He led the design of a global data infrastructure simulator, modeling follow-the-sun engineering, to evaluate the impact of competing architectures on the performance, availability and reliability of the system for Ford Motor Company. He has been involved in developing E-Educational software for Microsoft via their I- Campus Program and with establishing the Accenture Technology Academy, an online resource for over 200,000 employees. He has 10 years of experience with learning management systems and has made deployments in America, Asia, and Europe. He teaches MIT courses on cybersecurity, engineering computation, and data science and has produced over 150 educational videos.</p>

                <h3>Dr. John Thomas</h3>
                <p>John has a doctorate from MIT focused on establishing a framework for purposefully designing for innovation, called the Archstand Theory. He has successfully applied this framework along with Prof. Nam Suh's Axiomatic Theory in the domain of finance. For instance, one of the products he designed saved Fidelity, trading costs over $1 billion over a period of 8 years. John has worked in the financial sector for over 20 years in various capacities covering buy-side, sell-side as well as the exchange. His current interests include exploring engineering applications of the interdisciplinary effort known as complexity sciences.</p>
